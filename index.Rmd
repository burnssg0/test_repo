# Markdown 

Markdown is a way to make fancy documnets. 
make sure you "knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors. 
Hashtags are how we make section levels of a doc. 

## Next level 
### Next level 
### Next level 
#### Next level 

# Basic Formatting 

This is **bold.** (that's double asterisks) or *italics*. (that's single asterisks) Or `code`.(that's back quotes) 

- this is the start of a list. 
- next item. 
- next item. 

1. this is a numbers list 
2. second item. 

To add a hyper link, do `[link text](url)`. 
For example, [go here](https://www.sewanee.edu)

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`, no spaces! hyphens. 
For example, [go here](#next-level).

To add more verticle space between blocks of text, use this: `&nbsp;` 

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; 

Should be more space now. 

** To include an image **
first put an image inside the foulder where your `Rmd` file is located. 
Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width="50%"}`

![](../images//IMG_5061.jpeg){width="20%"}

# RMarkdown 

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in. 

You can do R stuff in the same line as text. For example. `r 3+3` will show as 6
(it would look like backtick lower-case-r space the code then backtick)

You could also do a full-milti-line CHUNK of R stuff: 

```{r chunk-name }
# ```{r}
3+3
#```
```

## Settings to controle how R chunks appear: 

- `eval=TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but
doesn't run it. 

- `echo=TRUE` : which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without
being seen. 

- `warnings=FALSE`: which will turn off warnings. 

- `fig.cap = "figure capption"` adds a figure caption. 

- `fig.width = 7` example of figure width. 

- `fig.height = 4` example of figure height. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this will be shown but not run
3+3 
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#this will be evaluated but not shown 
4+4 
```


# Bringing in real data 

### getting data
To manualy set working directory while building up my Rmarkdown file, 
just gi to Session > set working directory > Source file location. 

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip=1) #ship=1 skips the first row that describes the data
```

### exploring data 

```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names 
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>%  sort
energy %>% pull(`Country/area`) %>% unique()
```

```{r }
#filter data 
fenergy <- energy %>% 
  filter(`Country/area` == 'United States of America (the)')
```

```{r }
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
p <-ggplot(fenergy,
       aes(x=Year,
           y=as.numeric(`Electricity statistics`),
           fill=Technology)) + #makes it be numeric
  geom_area() 
  ggplotly(p)
```
